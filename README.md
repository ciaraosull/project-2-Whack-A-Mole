The design of the site was inspired by researching other online games to discover what aspects of their design made a positive user experience. The sites were accessed across several devices to understand what layout and features worked best on each device and had a positive impact on the user.

## Features
1. **Favicon**
    * A favicon was generated by uploading a mole logo to [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).  This then generated a 16x16 icon that was saved in the assests images folder and linked in the head section of the html.
    * A favicon consistant with the theme of whack-a-mole was chosen to be asscociated with this website as an extra visual support for the user and to create a positive user experience.  It should create brand awareness and recognizability for the user visually and help them find the page quicker and easier.

4. **Feature 4**

5. **Page Not Found - 404 Page**
    * A customised 404 page not found was added to the site to support the professionalism design and ensure appropriate link was added back to the main site to guide users who come across this message.

    * An image from the website is used for consistancy and the link back to the main website has a line underneath and letter spacing on hover to provide feedback to the user.  Inline css was used within the 404.html page to prevent further errors being shown if the style sheet fails to load from a link.
