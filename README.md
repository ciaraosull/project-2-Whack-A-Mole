# **Design**

The design of the site was inspired by researching other online games to discover what aspects of their design made a positive user experience. The sites were accessed across several devices to understand what layout and features worked best on each device and had a positive impact on the user.

## Features
1. **Favicon**
    * A favicon was generated by uploading a mole image for the logo to [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).  This then generated an icon that was saved in the assests images folder and linked in the head section of the html.
    * A favicon consistant with the theme of whack-a-mole was chosen to be asscociated with this website as an extra visual support for the user and to create a positive user experience.  It should create brand awareness and recognizability for the user visually and help them find the page quicker and easier.

4. **Feature 4**

5. **Page Not Found - 404 Page**
    * A customised 404 page not found was added to the site to support the professionalism design and ensure appropriate link was added back to the main site to guide users who come across this message.

    * An image from the website is used for consistancy and the link back to the main website has a line underneath and letter spacing on hover to provide feedback to the user.  Inline css was used within the 404.html page to prevent further errors being shown if the style sheet fails to load from a link.

## **Interesting Issues, Bugs Found & Fixed**

**1. Clicking on Mole Bug**

Three issues arose while trying to impliment addEventListener to the moles.  This fuction was to have several events happen once the moles were clicked, such as add to the score and sned the moles back down the hole once clicked.  

    * The first problem was that the moles were treated as an array.  As such the forEach method threw an error in the console stating that forEach was not a function.  As getElementByClassName was used to select the moles, this returned them as a HTML collection so there were 3 options to choose from.  At first a for(of) loop was chosen to iterate through the array to then assign the addEventListener.  However, it was decided to use querySelectorAll instead, as this returned a NodeList, which is not live, so if any changes to the DOM happen this won't alter the NodeList.  After the querySelectorAll was used for the moles then forEach was used and the addEventLister applied to all moles returned.

    * After this was fixed, however a second problem came to light.  The addEventListener still did not seem to be taking affect.  Using Chrome DevTools to inspect closer at the areas chosen when the moles were clicked it showed what was actually being clicked was the hole divs and as the mole divs were sitting behind them, they could not be clicked.  To fix this the z-index was removed from the mole divs and the addEventListener then worked as they could be clicked.

    * The third problem then arose because the z-index was removed, the moles now sat in front of the holes and could be seen making the transition from Top: 100% to Top: 0.  To fix this, the transition of 2seconds was removed, and moles now just appear out of the hole and disappear again without a raising up effect.  Given more time, the css could be altered to place the divs containing the holes lower down so the Top: 0 starts at the hole opening.  However, as time was a constraint at this time, the removal of the transition was used.

**2. Peek Function**
    * An issue arose with the Play button not being diasabled and it was discovered that the user may be able to click Play during the game play causing the Peek Function to run multiple times simultainiously.

    * Interestingly though, by discovering this bug, running the Peek Function twice simultainiously gave the effect of more than one mole peeking out at a time.

    * The Play button was disabled during game play to fix this error, however, the Peek Function was placed in the game twice to keep this very nice effect.  Any more than running Peek twice at any one time, however, just made all the moles pop up almost at the same time constantly.

**Bugs Found & Not Fixed**

To Do List:

Can double click on mole if quick enough to add more points to score.  Need to disable click and enable again for noext mole.  Fix - look to how I disabled the play button and apply code with a time interval added on.

* Validator Testing

1. The [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) site was used to validate the **HTML** code.

2. The [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) site was also used to validate the **CSS** code.

3. **Lighthouse** was accessed through Developer Tools in Chrome to check the site for performance, acessibility, best practice and SEO.

## Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.

On the left hand side menu, choose Pages.

From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main branch and then press Save.

The next page will displlay a notice stating the site is ready to be published.

Refresh GitHub and the display will now state the site is published.

The live link is: https://ciaraosull.github.io/project-2-whack-a-mole/

Visual Studio (VS) Code was the Integrated Development Environment used to develop this website.

**Version Control**
Git was used as the version control software. Commands such as git add ., git status, git commit and git push were used to add, save, stage and push the code to the GitHub repository where the source code is stored.

**Cloning**

To clone this repository from GitHub to a local computer to make it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits or contribute use the following steps:

On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Click Here for Reposititory Link

Above the list of files, click Code.

click Use GitHub CLI, then the copy icon.

Open Git Bash and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

Type git clone, and then paste the URL that was copied from step 3 above.

Press Enter to create the local clone.
